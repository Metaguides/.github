Metaguides is a Sub DAO, or a Chili Pod or Meta Cartel. It was formed in order to guide grant requests through Meta Cartel. This program was succesful in getting grants out however it was often slow and time consuming for everybody involved. Metaguides was no longer required to fulfill this function. Something that did emerge from analysis of many grant applications was the desire for many projects to simply be connected to the Meta Cartel ecosystem. With this, the Metaguides were able to evolve into a DAO that could aide in that service.
